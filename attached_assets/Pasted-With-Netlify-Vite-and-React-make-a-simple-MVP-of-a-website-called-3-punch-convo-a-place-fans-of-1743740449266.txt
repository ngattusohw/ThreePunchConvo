With Netlify, Vite and React, make a simple MVP of a website called 3 punch convo -- a place fans of UFC/MMA can go and chat, see latest news and schedules

Forum functionality

Users can make posts (start threads)

Post can include text, emojis, images, gifs, and polls (no vids or voice notes)

Users can reply to an initial post or a reply

Users can like, dislike, quote reply, or POTD (post of the day, once a
day per user) an original post

Users can like, dislike, or quote reply to a reply to a post or a reply to
a reply

Post with most recent post time or reply time should appear at the top

Users should get notifications when their original posts or post replies
are replied to

MMA schedule functionality

Need to bring in MMA schedule from some aggregator site (not
just for UFC but other MMA organizations as well). I think we
can do this from espn.com

Rankings functionality

Users should be ranked and assigned a status based on the
algorithm

Status will update dynamically in real-time based on algorithm
to assign individual users a status and ranking (numerical from
1-x). There can be a tie if algorithm produces the same score
for more than one user and it should display “4-T Albert Smith”

Users should be able to scroll through rankings

Statuses should be in decreasing order from best to worst – Hall
of Famer, Champion, Contender, Ranked Poster, Competitor,
Regional Poster, Amateur

Pros

Pro fighters, media, and MMA personalities that Admins can tag in their
dashboard. These people need to have some kind of ”blue checkmark”
validation and are automatically tagged w a status of Hall of Famer (they are
also not a part of the rankings nor is the algorithm tracked for them)

Dashboard functionality

Can be accessed on the web if easier

Admins and mods will need to have access

Need to be able to execute on functionalities described in prior
slide

Admins need to be able to add advertisements to add carousel
